# Wordle Game (JavaFX Project)

This is a Wordle game I built for a class project using Java and JavaFX. The goal was to recreate the classic Wordle experience with GUI elements. This is a fully working version of the game, giving players six tries to guess a five-letter word.

## What It Does

- GUI built with JavaFX and FXML
- Randomly selects a five-letter word from a txt file for players to guess
- Gives color-based feedback after each guess:
  - Green = correct letter, correct spot
  - Yellow = correct letter, wrong spot
  - Gray = letter not in the word
- Keeps track of current progress through saved data read/written to other txt files
